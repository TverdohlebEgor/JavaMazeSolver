# JavaMazeSolver
A simple maze solver (with gui) in java to prepare myself to my OOP uni exam 

# Final Tought
This little project born with the only idea of testing a bit how the MVC paradigmes workes in small projects. 
I have to say that is hard to give a fair jugment since I put very little time into projecting this system, and thus I may have created some uncessary layers.
In this years I've got a lot closer to the data-oriented way of programming and this experience certenly haven't contributed to change my mind, as I recalled 
working in GUI with React, this ideas of super compartimalization always force you to pass a lot of messages and even if In theory MVC is sound I think is very
frustrating to use on this kind of 1-2 day project. Anyway I will probably make another one putting more effort on the projecting part to see if the great majority of my 
discomfort came from that but I currently doubt. Anyway the project is working even if it lacks tons of basic features. Most importantly

## Knowned Bugs
- The size of the button is not right before you update the main panel resizing it

## Feature that would make sense add
- A button to clear the screen
- Find a way to create walls dragging the mouse cliccked and not one by one (guessing it may be hard for library limitation)
- Color progresivelly changing showing the search wile is been done
- Other searching algoritms
- Implement my own PriorityQueue (for the sake of it)

I hardly think I will continue this project but better to never say never
